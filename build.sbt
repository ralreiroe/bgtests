// The simplest possible sbt build file is just one line:

scalaVersion := "2.11.7"
name := "bigdata"
organization := "ch.epfl.scala"
version := "1.0"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.2.4" % "test"

libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" % "spark-core_2.11" % "2.1.0"
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" % "spark-sql_2.11" % "2.1.0" % "provided"

//scalacOptions += "-Xlog-implicits"


// ============================================================================

// Most moderately interesting Scala projects don't make use of the very simple
// build file style (called "bare style") used in this build.sbt file. Most
// intermediate Scala projects make use of so-called "multi-project" builds. A
// multi-project build makes it possible to have different folders which sbt can
// be configured differently for. That is, you may wish to have different
// dependencies or different testing frameworks defined for different parts of
// your codebase. Multi-project builds make this possible.

// Here's a quick glimpse of what a multi-project build looks like for this
// build, with only one "subproject" defined, called `root`:

// lazy val root = (project in file(".")).
//   settings(
//     inThisBuild(List(
//       organization := "ch.epfl.scala",
//       scalaVersion := "2.12.1"
//     )),
//     name := "hello-world"
//   )

// To learn more about multi-project builds, head over to the official sbt
// documentation at http://www.scala-sbt.org/documentation.html
